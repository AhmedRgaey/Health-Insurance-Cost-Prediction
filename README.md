## :writing_hand: Project Description:

This is a medical insurance cost prediction model that uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm to predict the medical insurance charges of a person based on the given data.
 
 ## :innocent: Motivation

To predict things have been never so easy. I used to wonder how Insurance amount is charged normally. So, in the mean time I came across this dataset and thought of working on it! Using this I wanted to know how few features determine our insurance amount!
